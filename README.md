# Perchly - Daily Mood Tracker

Peter says hello & welcome! This is **Perchly**. An easy-to-use app for tracking your mood throughout the year, with comprehensive monthly, weekly, and daily breakdowns. Peter just wants you to check in when you can.

# Use
## Overview (Yearly)
When you launch the app, you're greeted with a graph of the year, where each day reflects the color of the corresponding mood for that day. If no mood was logged for a given day, that day will appear grey. 

## Timeframes (Month, Week, Day)
You can select `month`, `week`, or `day`, where you'll see refined overviews of your moods in those given time frames. Selecting a specific day in the `monthly` or `weekly` tabs will take you to that specific day in the `daily` tab, where you can view the logged mood and entry. 

## Search
You can view your previous entries either by selecting the days from the `month`, `week`, or `day` tabs, or by searching for them in the `search` tab, where you can enter keywords or specific moods to find entries. 

## Profile
On the `profile` tab, you can view your info, streaks, total entries, mood distribution, weekly patterns, and badges you've earned. 


# Gallery

These screenshots include actual entries I've made, which I've omitted from the screenshots (overview, weekly, & daily). Text would otherwise appear in the relevant containers.
